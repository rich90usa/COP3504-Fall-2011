Geometric Turtle Analysis
(REALLY, LOOK AT THE UML - IT COVERS THE ARCHITECTURE PRETTY WELL)
internal float variables:
	real
	imaginary

getReal
    input: none
    output: float real
    modifies: none
    constraints: max/min float
    relationships: none
    assumptions: none
    
getImaginary
    input: none
    output: float imaginary
    modifies: none
    constraints: max/min float
    relationships: none
    assumptions: none

setReal
    input: float to assign to real
    output: none
    modifies: none
    constraints: max/min float
    relationships: none
    assumptions: none
    
setImaginary
    input: float to assign to imaginary
    output: none
    modifies: none
    constraints: max/min float
    relationships: none
    assumptions: none

perform
    input: string operation, ComplexNumber comNum
    output: ComplexNumber
    modifies: none
    constraints: max/min float

magComplex
    input: none
    output: float
    modifies: none
    constraints: max/min float
    relationships: square root of the sum powers of real and imaginary
    assumptions: none

toString
    input: none
    output: String
