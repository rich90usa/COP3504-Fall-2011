Geometric Turtle Analysis
(REALLY, LOOK AT THE UML - IT COVERS THE ARCHITECTURE PRETTY WELL)

drawSide
    input: length and angle as double
    output: none
    modifies: turtle position/state
    constraints: max/min double
    relationships: none
    assumptions: none
    
rectangle
    input: height and width as double
    output: none
    modifies: turtle position/state
    constraints: max/min double
    relationships: depends on drawSide
    assumptions: none

square
    input: length as double
    output: none
    modifies: turtle position/state
    constraints: max/min double
    relationships: depends on rectangle
    assumptions: none
    
pentagon
    input: length as double
    output: none
    modifies: turtle position/state
    constraints: max/min double
    relationships: depends on drawSide
    assumptions: none

hexagon
    input: length as double
    output: none
    modifies: turtle position/state
    constraints: max/min double
    relationships: depends on drawSide
    assumptions: none

letterC
    input: height, width, thickness as double - facing as char
    output: none
    modifies: turtle positon/state
    constraints: max/min double - thickness probably shouldn't exceed height or width, may get undesired results
    relationships: depends on drawSide
    assumptions: none
