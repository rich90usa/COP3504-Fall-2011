The test plan is to test a bunch of numbers both on and between boundry conditions. Boundry conditions can be clarified as situations where powers of the base occur.

The results of these test cases are expected to be the correct values for these conversions - as corroborated by http://www.cleavebooks.co.uk/scol/calnumba.htm
